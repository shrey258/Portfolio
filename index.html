          <p>
                Hi! My name is Shreyansh Gupta. 
                I am a student of Srm institute Chennai pursuing Btech CSE.
                I live in <b>Siliguri</b> a city in West Bengal. I am a total <b>Beginner</b> in coding.
                This is my First website. I was introduceed to coding when i was in class 6, The language was C++. 
                This was the phase which ignited my intrest in coding, and till now my intrest is at peak about coding.
                But due to time and school curriculum it has brought me back to where i started. But i am going to 
                start it again ,And i am too excited about it. I am starting off with Javascript.
                My hobbies are to listen music, play music, clicking pictures{as u can see all the pictures used are clicked by me:)}
                ,and playing table tennis. As i am beginning my coding journey i dont have any projects to show.:(
